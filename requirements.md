## IN Scope - What our product will do:

Stimulate the user via visual and audio media
Provide an opportunity for the user to interact with media by choosing their preferred media
Provide the user an opportunity to consider their feelings and mood and select "vibes" that align
Expose the user to new music or at minimum music others believe would be pleasing to them.

## OUT of scope - What our product will not do:

Medically treat the user's health or mood issues

## Our MVP functionality will be:

* the user will understand the site and be invited to the listening room experience
* the user will choose a visual representation (image(s) or video(s)) that corresponds to a mood they are currently in or want to experience
* the site will recommend a song for the listener to enjoy based off of songs with a range of beats per minute that align to the images the user selected
* the user will then be able to listen to a song that is the result of their selections or recommended a playlist they can play songs from that correspond to their selection

## Our stretch goals will be:

* the user will then choose a visual representation (image or video) that corresponds to a genre of music they are in the mood for
* user shares moods or feedback on songs they are presented in the listening room
* user receives a playlist verses a single song in the listening room
