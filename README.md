Users complete a questionnaire to determine their personal mood, and based on their responses, the app assigns a specific beats per minute (BPM) range for their mood. For instance, if a user indicates a sad mood, the app suggests songs with a BPM range of 50-75 that match their mood.

This project addresses the challenge of finding music that aligns with a person's current mood. Often, users struggle to discover songs that match their emotions at a particular moment. By creating a system that analyzes users' moods through a questionnaire and recommends songs with suitable beats per minute (BPM) ranges, the application simplifies the process of curating personalized playlists. This solution aims to enhance the overall music discovery experience and provide users with a more enjoyable and emotionally resonant listening experience.
